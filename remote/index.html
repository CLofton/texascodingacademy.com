          Austin Coding Academy uses state of the art, remote technology to allow
          students from anywhere in the world to experience class as if they 
          were present in person. In addition to live lectures, Q&amp;Aâ€™s and
          project support, our remote students can attend remote office hours
          to receive one-on-one tutoring. They can interact with other
          students, and the instructor can even take over
          their computer to help them out of a jam. ACA Remote is a great option for
          someone who does not live in Austin.

        "I just completed the entire Full Stack curriculum at Austin Coding Academy and not only did they help me transition my career into coding, they helped me land a JavaScript Engineering job before I even graduated. The instructors are 'wicked smart', the curriculum is challenging in a good way, and the community is incredibly supportive. I recommend anyone looking to upgrade their skill set or a complete career change to look no further than ACA for the most affordable and flexible option available."

        "I was reluctant to attend an immersive course but I wasn't making much progress on my own. I found ACA's flexible option and decided to take the leap. I can honestly say that it was the best investment I've made. From the very beginning, what set ACA apart (and what made me stay) is their open door policy and attention to each student. They are always looking for ways to improve the school based on feedback from the students. They are also building an amazing community full of inspiring and supportive people. I have made friends, gained confidence and found a sweet job thanks to ACA."

        "Challenging classes lead by an incredible team! As a (previously) non-technical person it was very very rewarding to learn coding in a way that suited my schedule and pace of learning. The structure and pace of their classes are great and enable you to really choose how and what you'd like to learn. The ACA team is comprised of professionals full of great resources for students to take advantage of. Highly recommend for those wanting to up their skill set or change careers all together."

        "Austin Coding Academy was a phenomenal experience for me. I had a little experience in web design and coding, so I knew I would enjoy it, but classes at ACA really pushed that passion forward. Instructors and staff are really driven and so obviously love what they do â€“ they all go the extra mile to make sure you are getting everything you can out of class. ACA really strives to make their environment community-oriented, which allowed me to learn from classmates and even make great friends! I'm astonished at the amount of knowledge I gained in three short months and would recommend ACA to anyone I know."

        "The people who run it are awesome and are very motivated to help people learn, hence the low prices. I loved the front-end beginner class (HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript). I had no prior experience with front-end or coding at all, and am now building websites on my own and making a great income from freelance work full-time. It required a lot of learning outside of class and working on things every day is crucial. I loved the productive environment and the teachers are very knowledgable. ACA gave me the right amount of structure, answered all of my questions, and set up a good foundation."

The course work and cirriculum are demanding, but never overwhelming and someone is always available to point you in the right direction.
